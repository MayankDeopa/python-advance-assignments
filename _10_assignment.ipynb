    "Ans: getattribute is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. getattr is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by getattribute, but for this getattribute and getattr both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, getattr returns a default value. So key difference is that getattr is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class.\n"
